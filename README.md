# Calculate Dense Trajectories for Controllable Video Generation

### The original code base can be found in the following repo https://github.com/AraMambreyan/Improved-Dense-Trajectories.


### The code has been modified to get trajectories for any given dataset. The generated trajectories are in the format that the following code base requires, https://github.com/zekunhao1995/ControllableVideoGen

### Only the train.py and the aeeval.py files need to be modified in the above mentioned code base, depending on the dataset used.

### Dataset - The experiment was performed on images of cats and dogs taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
